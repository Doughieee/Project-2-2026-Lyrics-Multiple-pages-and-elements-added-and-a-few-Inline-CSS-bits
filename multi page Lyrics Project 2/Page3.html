        [Verse 1]
        Feel the rhythm of the streets
        Neon lights and neon dreams
        Bloody fists they feel no pain
        When there’s so much more to gain
        Hunting season if you will
        Tell me where you'd rather be
        I can hardly see the moon
        Hope we'll get there pretty soon

        [Pre-Chorus]
        Trying so hard to release
        You out of the misery
        Hold on to your wishes
        If you can't hold on to me

        [Chorus]
        Forgive me for letting you down
        Forgive me for letting you down again
        I guess I'm not strong enough
        Right now

        [Verse 2]
        They will finally feel the flames
        Flames that run down through my veins
        I will make the city burn
        We're not planning to return
        You might also like

        Tyler, The Creator
        [Pre-Chorus]
        Trying so hard to be free
        To make you see what I see
        Hold on to your wishes
        If you can't hold on to me

        [Chorus]
        Forgive me for letting you down
        Forgive me for letting you down again
        I guess I'm not strong enough
        Right now
        Forgive me for letting you down
        Forgive me for letting you down again
        I guess I'm not strong enough
        Right now

        [Outro]
        Oh, my love, love, love
        Oh, let you down
        Oh, let you down
        Let you down
        Oh, let you down
