        [Verse 1]
        Eyes, burning a way through me
        Eyes, destroying so sweetly
        Now, there is a fire in me
        A fire that burns

        [Chorus]
        This fire is out of control
        I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
        This fire is out of control
        I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
        This fire is out of control
        This fire is out of control
        This fire is out of control
        And I'll burn

        [Verse 2]
        Eyes, boring a way through me
        Paralyse, controlling completely
        Now, there is a fire in me
        A fire that burns

        [Chorus]
        This fire is out of control
        I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
        This fire is out of control
        I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
        This fire is out of control, then I
        I'm out of control and I burn
