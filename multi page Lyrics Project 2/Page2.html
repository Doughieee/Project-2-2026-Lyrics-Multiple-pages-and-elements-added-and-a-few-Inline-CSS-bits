        [Verse 1]
        I couldn't wait for you to come and clear the cupboards
        But now you're gone and leaving nothing but a sign
        Another evening, I'll be sitting reading in-between your lines
        Because I miss you all the time

        [Pre-Chorus]
        So, get away
        Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
        And let yourself go
        You know you didn't lose your self-control
        Let's start at the rainbow
        Turn away
        Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
        And let yourself go
        Is that a compromise?

        [Chorus]
        So, what do you wanna do? What's your point of view?
        There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
        A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
        I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
        'Cause I really wanna stay at your housе
        And I hopе this works out
        But you know how much you broke me apart
        I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
        I don't wanna know

        [Verse 2]
        And I'm awarе that you were lying in the gutter
        'Cause I did everything to be there by your si-i-ide
        So, when you tell me I'm the reason, I just can't believe the lies
        And why do I still want to call you? (Call you, call you, call you)

        [Chorus]
        So, what do you wanna do? What's your point of view?
        There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
        A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
        I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
        'Cause I really wanna stay at your house

        I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
        I don't wanna know

        [Bridge]
        Ohh
        Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
        I don't know why I'm no one

        [Pre-Chorus]
        So, get away
        Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
        And let yourself go
        You know you didn't lose your self-control
        Let's start at the rainbow
